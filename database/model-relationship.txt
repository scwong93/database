select count(booking.guest_id), guest.first_name, guest.last_name from guest join booking on guest.id = booking.guest_id group by guest.first_name, guest.last_name having count(booking.guest_id) > 1;

Created an image of my diagram at: https://imgur.com/a/pRIyf

I needed 3 tables - student, class, grade. The student tables will hold general information such as the student ID (primary key), name, address, and contact information. The class table will have a class ID (primary key), title of the class, and subject it belongs to. The grade table will have two foreign keys - class ID and student ID, along with the letter grade received.

select class.title, student.name from student join grade on student.studentid = grade.studentid join class on class.classid = grade.classid group by class.title, student.name having class.title = 'Biology';

select class.title, grade.grade, count(distinct grade.grade) from student join grade on student.studentid = grade.studentid join class on class.classid = grade.classid group by class.title, grade.grade having class.title = 'Biology';

select class.title, count(student.studentid) from student join grade on student.studentid = grade.studentid join class on class.classid = grade.classid group by class.title;

select class.title, count(grade.studentid) from class join grade on class.classid = grade.classid group by class.title order by count(grade.studentid) desc limit 1;
